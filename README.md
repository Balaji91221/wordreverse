# Word Reversal Algorithm with Visualization

This project is a simple web application that demonstrates a word reversal algorithm. It includes a visualization of the algorithm's steps, showing the reverse process of a given sentence in real-time. The project is built using React and JavaScript, and allows users to interactively see how the words in a sentence are reversed.
